# UK Test

## Dependencies
Please ensure you have the following installed:
* .Net 8 SDK (you may need to ensure your Visual Studio installation is fully up to date)
* Node v20.10.0 (min version)

## Major To-Do
* I couldn’t complete the proper validation on server-side. However, I had mentioned in my code comments that I like to implement it using model validation techniques for each GetModel, PutModel, and PostModel API Requests and didn’t provide a code. As next stage, I would use following guide to complete the task: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/web-api/overview/formats-and-model-binding/model-validation-in-aspnet-web-api
* Currently UI/HTML use regular accessibility techniques for keyborad, I would use `aria` for proper implementation
